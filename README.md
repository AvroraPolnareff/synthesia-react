# synthesia-react

Synthesia app clone, written on typescript, with react as rendering library.

## goals:
- [ ] base app (load midi -> play track -> note counts on key press)
- [ ] database of loaded midi tracks
- [ ] playback sounds
- [ ] process user input from keyboard
- [ ] add score system
- [ ] add ability to play multiple tracks
- [ ] add follow mode (playback pauses, when note wasn't pressed)

## maybe I try to add:
- [ ] support tempo change
- [ ] standalone version (electron)
- [ ] react-native version
